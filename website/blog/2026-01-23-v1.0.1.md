## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Modern GUI Dashboard**: A cross-platform graphical interface (built with Fyne) to manage everything visually. No more complex command-line arguments.
*   **Custom Installation Paths**: Install any WSL distro into a custom directory or drive of your choice, bypassing the default system drive limitation and saving C: drive space.
*   **Multi-Instance & Side-by-Side Support**: Easily install multiple instances of the same distribution (e.g., `Ubuntu-Work` and `Ubuntu-Personal`), or keep different versions side-by-side.
*   **Offline Capability**: Automatically downloads and caches official Appx/AppxBundle packages. Download once, install many times.
*   **Safety & Robustness**: Built-in validation prevents accidental overwrites and ensures clean installations.
*   **Automation Ready**: The underlying PowerShell scripts support headless/silent operation for advanced users and CI/CD pipelines.

## 📦 What's Included

*   **DistroNexus.exe**: The main GUI application with a bundled high-resolution icon.
*   **PowerShell Scripts**: Located in `scripts/`, handling the core logic for downloading and installing distros.
*   **Configuration**: Simple JSON-based configuration in `config/settings.json`.
