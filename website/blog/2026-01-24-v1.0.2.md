    *   **Open Terminal**: Open a new terminal window for a running instance (supports custom starting directory).
    *   **Stop**: Force terminate running instances directly from the UI.
    *   **Move**: Relocate WSL instances to different drives or folders without data loss (ideal for moving off C: drive).
    *   **Rename**: Change the display/registered name of your instances.
    *   **Credentials**: Reset or set default user credentials easily.

*   **Package Manager**:
    *   **Online Sources**: Fetch and update the latest distro list from the cloud.

    *   View locally cached distribution packages.
    *   Monitor disk usage of the cache.
    *   Delete unused packages to free up space.

*   **Robust Logging**:
    *   New centralized logging system for all PowerShell operations.
    *   Logs are stored in `logs/` directory with automatic rotation.

*   **Redesigned UI/UX**:
    *   **Modern Layout**: Transit to a cleaner layout with dedicated toolbar and scrollable content areas.
    *   **Interactive Cards**: "My Installs" cards now feature integrated action buttons for instant management.
    *   **Improved Dialogs**: Resizable dialogs for "Rename" and "Credentials" to handle varying text lengths.
