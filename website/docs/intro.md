# Introduction

**DistroNexus** is a comprehensive GUI application (powered by PowerShell) designed to simplify the management, downloading, and custom installation of Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) distributions.

It acts as a central hub for your WSL needs, allowing you to forge your perfect Linux environment on Windows.

## Why DistroNexus?

Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a powerful tool, but managing multiple distributions, installing them to custom locations (not just `C:` drive), and handling offline installations can be cumbersome via command line. 

DistroNexus solves this by providing:

*   **GUI Convenience**: No more memorizing `wsl.exe` flags.
*   **Disk Space Management**: Install large distros on your secondary drives easily.
*   **Portability**: Move instances between drives without losing data.
*   **Offline Capability**: Download once, install many times without re-downloading.

## Key Features

*   **Modern GUI Dashboard**: A cross-platform graphical interface (built with Fyne).
*   **Centralized Download**: Automatically download the latest offline packages (Appx/AppxBundle).
*   **Custom Installation**: Install any WSL distro into a custom directory.
*   **Advanced Instance Management**: Start, Stop, Terminate, Move, Rename.
*   **Safety Checks**: Built-in validation prevents overwriting existing instances.
*   **Side-by-Side Versions**: Easily install multiple versions of the same distro.
